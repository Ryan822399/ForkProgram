	This program will prompt the user to enter in a target string from the below document, then ask the user to enter a replacement string. The program then spawns a child process to handle the replacement of the string. If the string does not exist within the document a programmed in bug will begin where a (.) is printed out everytime the child process attempts to replace a string within the document. The only way for the child process to end is by killing it through another terminal. On completion of the child process it exits itself.

There are many reasons behind this, including it’s treatment of objects and the ability to build applications quickly. There are some people who feel that it’s unjustly popular, due to a lot of JavaScript’s perceived shortcomings when compared with more traditional programming languages. JavaScript has some strange quirks and behavior that bothers some engineers. One thing everyone can agree on is that JavaScript is one of the most used languages today, and for all intents and purposes it seems to be staying that way. Knowing JavaScript is essential for any web developer. To remedy JavaScript’s shortcomings, developers have created a vast amount of libraries, each trying to solve their own problem, or plenty trying to solve the same problem in marginally different ways. Being familiar these libraries has become essential, even if it is merely to be aware that you can use them to ease your development process. Some of the most widely used libraries are as follows: Lodash, Ramda, and TypeScript. The maintainers of JavaScript language are of course aware of these needs and are adding these sought after features into the core JavaScript standard as time passes. There is one distinction that needs to be addressed, however, the differences between ECMAScript and JavaScript.";
